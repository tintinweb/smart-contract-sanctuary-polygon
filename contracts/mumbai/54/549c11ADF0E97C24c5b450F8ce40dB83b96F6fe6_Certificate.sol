/**
 * @title An ERC721a contract that issues non-transferable certificates of carbon removal.
 * @author Nori Inc.
 * @notice This contract issues sequentially increasing ERC721 token IDs to purchasers of certificates of carbon
 * removal in Nori's marketplace. The carbon removals that supply each certificate are accounted for using ERC1155
 * tokens in the Removal contract. Upon purchase, ownership of the relevant Removal token IDs and balances is
 * transferred to this contract.
 *
 *
 * ##### Additional behaviors and features:
 *
 * - [Upgradeable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable)
 * - [Initializable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#multiple-inheritance)
 * - [Pausable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/security#Pausable): all functions that mutate state are
 * pausable.
 * - [Role-based access control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control)
 *    - `CERTIFICATE_OPERATOR_ROLE`: The only role that can transfer certificates after they are minted.
 *    - `PAUSER_ROLE`: Can pause and unpause the contract.
 *    - `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: This is the only role that can add/revoke other accounts to any of the roles.
 * - [Can receive ERC1155 tokens](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc1155#IERC1155Receiver): A
 * certificate is minted and internal accounting ties the certificate to the ERC1155 tokens upon receipt.

 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }
 * ```

 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
