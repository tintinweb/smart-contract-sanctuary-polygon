 * @title EIP-20: ERC-20 Token Standard
 *
 * @notice The ERC-20 (Ethereum Request for Comments 20), proposed by Fabian Vogelsteller in November 2015,
 *      is a Token Standard that implements an API for tokens within Smart Contracts.
 *
 * @notice It provides functionalities like to transfer tokens from one account to another,
 *      to get the current token balance of an account and also the total supply of the token available on the network.
 *      Besides these it also has some other functionalities like to approve that an amount of
 *      token from an account can be spent by a third party account.
 *
 * @notice If a Smart Contract implements the following methods and events it can be called an ERC-20 Token
 *      Contract and, once deployed, it will be responsible to keep track of the created tokens on Ethereum.
 *
 * @notice See https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/
