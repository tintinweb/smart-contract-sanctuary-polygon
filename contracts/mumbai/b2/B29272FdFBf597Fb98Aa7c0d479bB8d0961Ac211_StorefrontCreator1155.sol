/**
 *
 * An ERC1155-based NFT contract which includes support for partitioned (bucketed) IPFS routes.
 *
 * This contract is a standard ERC1155 contract with modifications to make the contract
 * allow for a dynamically-sized collection of NFTs to be minted on it over a prolonged
 * period of time.
 *
 * These differences are:
 *
 *   1. The contact leverages ownership of the contract (OwnableUpgradeable), however it also
 *      allows for the NFT minting method (`mintNFT`) to be only executable via a
 *      `minter` wallet.
 *
 *   2. The `uri` mechanism of the contract defers to a sub contract which acts as
 *      a router to determine what IPFS directory CID value will be used for the uri
 *      of the provided tokenId.
 *
 * While the behavior of "minting over a prolonged period of time" is something that isn't
 * common in the crypto space, the intent with this contract is to only allow for minting
 * to occur until the collection is complete. Once complete, ownership and minting on the
 * contract will be relinquished.
 *
 *
 * ## How the minting logic works
 *
 * The `mintNFT` method works much the same as any public minting function on an ERC721 or
 * ERC1155 contract. The main difference here is that only the `minter` wallet can execute
 * this method instead of the `owner` of the contract. The `minter` wallet is a standard
 * 0x0 address that can be set via the `setMinter()` method and it can be the same as the
 * owner of the wallet.
 *
 * The reason why this contract makes use of a minter/owner split is so that the deployment
 * and configuration of contract is done via an offline wallet while minting of new NFTs is
 * done using a wallet that is distributed on the backend.
 *
 *
 * ## How the `uri` assembling works
 *
 * With a standard ERC1155 contract, all NFT URI values (which point to their respective
 * metadata files) are bound to a single URI structure with a consistent domain/path prefix.
 * This design choice is done as such by ERC1155 to optimize storage of NFT entries within
 * the contract (since no URL values need to be stored).
 *
 * While this feature of ERC1155 works well, it doesn't allow for a collection of NFTs to
 * be extended without some kind of variable change to the prefix of the `uri`. In other
 * words, you would need to introduce a setter/getter value to change the IPFS prefix if
 * new NFT metadata files are introduced into the collection.
 *
 * The contract below changes how the `uri` method works by delegating the IPFS CID resolution
 * logic to a "router" contract. The router contract will execute its own logic given the `ID`
 * value and return the correct IPFS CID based on what IPFS directory that `ID` entry was
 * registered.
 *
 * See [Structured10Router.sol] for more info.

/**
 *
 * A custom contract that acts as a CID registry for IPFS directories.
 *
 * This contract is a delegate contract used by the [Structured10MRelease] contract
 * for its `uri` contruction code. The purpose of it is to determine what IPFS CID
 * value to use for a given NFT ID.
 *
 * The reason why this code exists is to allow the Structured10MRelease ERC1155 contract
 * to allow for NFTs to be registered even if the underlying NFT collection expands in size.
 * This is usually not possible with a ERC1155 contract, unless IPFS isn't used (i.e. you
 * use your own domain to host the NFT metadata). Because IPFS directories (i.e. where the CID
 * reflects the contents of a directory) cannot be updated without the CID changing, this router
 * will handle that CID changing behavior throughout the collection being published. Once the
 * NFT collection is complete, then the ownership of this contract and the parent
 * Structured10MRelease contract will be relinquished so that the NFT collection stays immutable.
 *
 * ## How the "routing" works
 * This contract allows for two things:
 *   1. Registration of new routes
 *   2. Resolution of routes via the provided ID
 *
 * When the contract is instantiated for the first time, it will require a `itemsPerRoute` value
 * which specifies how many IPFS metadata files will be stored in each IPFS directory. Then,
 * when a route is registered (via the `registerRoute()` method), the provided `index` value is
 * used to reference which IPFS directory the route lives in (and what the `cid` value is).
 *
 * With routes registered, when the `lookup()` method is called, it can determine what directory
 * (or route) the provided `itemIndex` lives in (this happens by diving the `itemIndex` by
 * the `itemsPerRoute` value). Once determined, the CID value for that `itemIndex` is returned.
 *
 * The parent contract (Structured10MRelease) then uses the CID value and places that into the
 * IPFS URI that it assembles within the `uri()` method.
 *
 * ## What happens if the routes collection expands?
 * When instantiated, the contract below will pre-fill an array of routes (for performance
 * reasons) so that it doesn't have to expand the size of the array everytime a new route is
 * filled. If an when a new route is added that goes beyond the pre-fill size, the registration
 * code will expand the array by inserting additional cells up until the new route index.
 *

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```

 * constructor() {
