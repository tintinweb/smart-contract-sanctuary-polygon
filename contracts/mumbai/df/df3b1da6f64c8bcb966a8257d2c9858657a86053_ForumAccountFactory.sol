/**
 * @title Safe - A multisignature wallet with support for confirmations using signed messages based on EIP-712.
 * @dev Most important concepts:
 *      - Threshold: Number of required confirmations for a Safe transaction.
 *      - Owners: List of addresses that control the Safe. They are the only ones that can add/remove owners, change the threshold and
 *        approve transactions. Managed in `OwnerManager`.
 *      - Transaction Hash: Hash of a transaction is calculated using the EIP-712 typed structured data hashing scheme.
 *      - Nonce: Each transaction should have a different nonce to prevent replay attacks.
 *      - Signature: A valid signature of an owner of the Safe for a transaction hash.
 *      - Guard: Guard is a contract that can execute pre- and post- transaction checks. Managed in `GuardManager`.
 *      - Modules: Modules are contracts that can be used to extend the write functionality of a Safe. Managed in `ModuleManager`.
 *      - Fallback: Fallback handler is a contract that can provide additional read-only functional for Safe. Managed in `FallbackManager`.
 *      Note: This version of the implementation contract doesn't emit events for the sake of gas efficiency and therefore requires a tracing node for indexing/
 *      For the events-based implementation see `SafeL2.sol`.
