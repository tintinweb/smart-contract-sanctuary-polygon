/**
 * @title Multi-Signature Wallet with Timelock and Survivorship
 * @notice Allows multiple parties to agree on transactions before execution.
 * @notice Enforces a delay before allowing a transaction to execute.
 * @author Original: Stefan George - <[email protected]>
 * @author Josh Davis - <[email protected]>
 * changelog:
 * - update to 0.8
 * - use Address set for owners
 * - add support for sending/holding/receiving tokens
 * - add function to veto transactions
 * - replace boolean executed flag with a status enum
 * - add support for upgrades
 * - add support for timelock
 * - add rights of survivorship
 *
 * Based heavily on the contract at https://polygonscan.com/address/0x355b8e02e7f5301e6fac9b7cac1d6d9c86c0343f
 *
 * This contract has
 * - A set of owners - addresses allowed to submit and confirm transactions
 * - A minimum number of owner for a quorum - the number of confirmations a
 *   transaction must have before it can be executed.
 * - A timelock period - the amount of time that must pass after a transaction
 *   has received the required number of confirmations before it can be
 *   executed.
 * - A live account timer - the amount of time after which, if an owner has
 *   not interacted with this contract (see #ping), that owner's vote is no
 *   longer required for a quorum. That is to say, inactive owners auto-
 *   confirm transactions.
 *
 * Any owner may veto a transaction. A vetoed transaction cannot be confirmed
 * or executed.
 *
 * A multi-sig wallet has a set of owners and a number of required signatures.
 * Any owner can submit a transaction, and the other owners can then confirm
 * the transaction.
 *
 * When a transaction reached the required number of confirmations, a countdown
 * timer begins. The transaction cannot be executed until the required amount
 * of time has passed. If enough owners revoke their confirmation so that the
 * transation no longer has the required number of confirmations, the timer is
 * reset, and will start over if the required number of confirmations is
 * reached again.
 *
 * If the timelock period is 0, then the timelock period feature is turned off.
 * Transactions will executed immediately once they reach the required number
 * of confirmations. If the timelock period is nonzero, transactions must be
 * executed manually by calling the `executeTransaction()` function.
 *
 * If the live account timer is 0, then the survivorship feature is turned off,
 * and owners are never considered to be inactive.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: If the number of required confirmations change, and the change
 * causes pending transactions to reach or fall below the new value, the
 * countdown timers are NOT automatically set or cleared. You can manually
 * set or reset the timer for a transaction by calling `resetConfirmationTimer()`.

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();

 *
 * @dev This is an abstract contract with basic wallet functionality. It can
 *     send and receive native crypto, ERC20 tokens, ERC721 tokens, ERC777 
 *     tokens, and ERC1155 tokens.
 * @dev The withdraw events are always emitted when crypto or tokens are
 *     withdrawn.
 * @dev The deposit events are less reliable, and normally only work when the
 *     safe transfer functions are used.
 * @dev There is no DepositERC20 event defined, because the ERC20 standard 
 *     doesn't include a safe transfer function.
 * @dev The withdraw functions are all marked as internal. Subclasses should
 *     add public withdraw functions that delegate to these, preferably with 
 *     some kind of control over who is allowed to call them.
