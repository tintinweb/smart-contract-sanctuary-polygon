 * @title DAO Market Maker with Adjustable Bonding Curve
 * @author DAOBox | (@pythonpete32)
 * @dev This contract is an non-upgradeable Aragon OSx Plugin
 *      It enables continuous minting and burning of tokens on an Augmented Bonding Curve, with part of the funds going
 * to the DAO and the rest being added to a reserve.
 *      The adjustable bonding curve formula is provided at initialization and determines the reward for minting and the
 * refund for burning.
 *      The DAO can also receive a sponsored mint, where another address pays to boost the reserve and the owner obtains
 * the minted tokens.
 *      Users can also perform a sponsored burn, where they burn their own tokens to enhance the value of the remaining
 * tokens.
 *      The DAO can set certain governance parameters like the theta (funding rate), or friction(exit fee)
 *
 * @notice This contract uses several external contracts and libraries from OpenZeppelin. Please review and understand
 * those before using this contract.
 * Also, consider the effects of the adjustable bonding curve and continuous minting/burning on your token's economics.
 * Use this contract responsibly.
