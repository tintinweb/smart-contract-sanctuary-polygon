/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]

/// @title IOrderBookV2
/// @notice An orderbook that deploys _strategies_ represented as interpreter
/// expressions rather than individual orders. The order book contract itself
/// behaves similarly to an `ERC4626` vault but with much more fine grained
/// control over how tokens are allocated and moved internally by their owners,
/// and without any concept of "shares". Token owners MAY deposit and withdraw
/// their tokens under arbitrary vault IDs on a per-token basis, then define
/// orders that specify how tokens move between vaults according to an expression.
/// The expression returns a maximum amount and a token input/output ratio from
/// the perpective of the order. When two expressions intersect, as in their
/// ratios are the inverse of each other, then tokens can move between vaults.
///
/// For example, consider order A with input TKNA and output TKNB with a constant
/// ratio of 100:1. This order in isolation has no ability to move tokens. If
/// an order B appears with input TKNB and output TKNA and a ratio of 1:100 then
/// this is a perfect match with order A. In this case 100 TKNA will move from
/// order B to order A and 1 TKNB will move from order A to order B.
///
/// IO ratios are always specified as input:output and are 18 decimal fixed point
/// values. The maximum amount that can be moved in the current clearance is also
/// set by the order expression as an 18 decimal fixed point value.
///
/// Typically orders will not clear when their match is exactly 1:1 as the
/// clearer needs to pay gas to process the match. Each order will get exactly
/// the ratio it calculates when it does clear so if there is _overlap_ in the
/// ratios then the clearer keeps the difference. In our above example, consider
/// order B asking a ratio of 1:110 instead of 1:100. In this case 100 TKNA will
/// move from order B to order A and 10 TKNA will move to the clearer's vault and
/// 1 TKNB will move from order A to order B. In the case of fixed prices this is
/// not very interesting as order B could more simply take order A directly for
/// cheaper rather than involving a third party. Indeed, Orderbook supports a
/// direct "take orders" method that works similar to a "market buy". In the case
/// of dynamic expression based ratios, it allows both order A and order B to
/// clear non-interactively according to their strategy, trading off active
/// management, dealing with front-running, MEV, etc. for zero-gas and
/// exact-ratio clearance.
///
/// The general invariant for clearing and take orders is:
///
/// ```
/// ratioA = InputA / OutputA
/// ratioB = InputB / OutputB
/// ratioA * ratioB = ( InputA * InputB ) / ( OutputA * OutputB )
/// OutputA >= InputB
/// OutputB >= InputA
///
/// ∴ ratioA * ratioB <= 1
/// ```
///
/// Orderbook is `IERC3156FlashLender` compliant with a 0 fee flash loan
/// implementation to allow external liquidity from other onchain DEXes to match
/// against orderbook expressions. All deposited tokens across all vaults are
/// available for flashloan, the flashloan MAY BE REPAID BY CALLING TAKE ORDER
/// such that Orderbook's liability to its vaults is decreased by an incoming
/// trade from the flashloan borrower. See `ZeroExOrderBookFlashBorrower` for
/// an example of how this works in practise.
///
/// Orderbook supports many to many input/output token relationship, for example
/// some order can specify an array of stables it would be willing to accept in
/// return for some ETH. This removes the need for a combinatorial explosion of
/// order strategies between like assets but introduces the issue of token
/// decimal handling. End users understand that "one" USDT is roughly equal to
/// "one" DAI, but onchain this is incorrect by _12 orders of magnitude_. This
/// is because "one" DAI is `1e18` tokens and "one" USDT is `1e6` tokens. The
/// orderbook is allowing orders to deploy expressions that define _economic
/// equivalence_ but this doesn't map 1:1 with numeric equivalence in a many to
/// many setup behind token decimal convensions. The solution is to require that
/// end users who place orders provide the decimals of each token they include
/// in their valid IO lists, and to calculate all amounts and ratios in their
/// expressions _as though they were 18 decimal fixed point values_. Orderbook
/// will then automatically rescale the expression values before applying the
/// final vault movements. If an order provides the "wrong" decimal values for
/// some token then it will simply calculate its own ratios and amounts
/// incorrectly which will either lead to no matching orders or a very bad trade
/// for the order owner. There is no way that misrepresenting decimals can attack
/// some other order by a counterparty. Orderbook DOES NOT read decimals from
/// tokens onchain because A. this would be gas for an external call to a cold
/// token contract and B. the ERC20 standard specifically states NOT to read
/// decimals from the interface onchain.
///
/// Token amounts and ratios returned by calculate order MUST be 18 decimal fixed
/// point values. Token amounts input to handle IO MUST be the exact absolute
/// values that move between the vaults, i.e. NOT rescaled to 18 decimals. The
/// author of the handle IO expression MUST use the token decimals and amounts to
/// rescale themselves if they want that logic, notably the expression author
/// will need to specify the desired rounding behaviour in the rescaling process.
///
/// When two orders clear there are NO TOKEN MOVEMENTS, only internal vault
/// balances are updated from the input and output vaults. Typically this results
/// in less gas per clear than calling external token transfers and also avoids
/// issues with reentrancy, allowances, external balances etc. This also means
/// that REBASING TOKENS AND TOKENS WITH DYNAMIC BALANCE ARE NOT SUPPORTED.
/// Orderbook ONLY WORKS IF TOKEN BALANCES ARE 1:1 WITH ADDITION/SUBTRACTION PER
/// VAULT MOVEMENT.
///
/// Dust due to rounding errors always favours the order. Output max is rounded
/// down and IO ratios are rounded up. Input and output amounts are always
/// converted to absolute values before applying to vault balances such that
/// orderbook always retains fully collateralised inventory of underlying token
/// balances to support withdrawals, with the caveat that dynamic token balanes
/// are not supported.
///
/// When an order clears it is NOT removed. Orders remain active until the owner
/// deactivates them. This is gas efficient as order owners MAY deposit more
/// tokens in a vault with an order against it many times and the order strategy
/// will continue to be clearable according to its expression. As vault IDs are
/// `uint256` values there are effectively infinite possible vaults for any token
/// so there is no limit to how many active orders any address can have at one
/// time. This also allows orders to be daisy chained arbitrarily where output
/// vaults for some order are the input vaults for some other order.
///
/// Expression storage is namespaced by order owner, so gets and sets are unique
/// to each onchain address. Order owners MUST TAKE CARE not to override their
/// storage sets globally across all their orders, which they can do most simply
/// by hashing the order hash into their get/set keys inside the expression. This
/// gives maximum flexibility for shared state across orders without allowing
/// order owners to attack and overwrite values stored by orders placed by their
/// counterparty.
///
/// Note that each order specifies its own interpreter and deployer so the
/// owner is responsible for not corrupting their own calculations with bad
/// interpreters. This also means the Orderbook MUST assume the interpreter, and
/// notably the interpreter's store, is malicious and guard against reentrancy
/// etc.
///
/// As Orderbook supports any expression that can run on any `IInterpreterV1` and
/// counterparties are available to the order, order strategies are free to
/// implement KYC/membership, tracking, distributions, stock, buybacks, etc. etc.

/// - receiving arbitrary `uint256[][]` supporting context to be made available
///   to the evaluated logic
/// - handling subsequent state changes in bulk in response to evaluated logic
/// - namespacing state changes according to the caller's preferences to avoid
///   unwanted key collisions
/// - exposing its internal function pointers to support external precompilation
///   of logic for more gas efficient runtime evaluation by the interpreter
///
/// The interface is designed to be stable across many versions and
/// implementations of an interpreter, balancing minimalism with features
/// required for a general purpose onchain interpreted compute environment.
///
/// The security model of an interpreter is that it MUST be resilient to
/// malicious expressions even if they dispatch arbitrary internal function
/// pointers during an eval. The interpreter MAY return garbage or exhibit
/// undefined behaviour or error during an eval, _provided that no state changes
/// are persisted_ e.g. in storage, such that only the caller that specifies the
/// malicious expression can be negatively impacted by the result. In turn, the
/// caller must guard itself against arbitrarily corrupt/malicious reverts and
/// return values from any interpreter that it requests an expression from. And
/// so on and so forth up to the externally owned account (EOA) who signs the
/// transaction and agrees to a specific combination of contracts, expressions
/// and interpreters, who can presumably make an informed decision about which
/// ones to trust to get the job done.
///
/// The state changes for an interpreter are expected to be produces by an `eval`
/// and passed to the `IInterpreterStoreV1` returned by the eval, as-is by the
/// caller, after the caller has had an opportunity to apply their own
/// intermediate logic such as reentrancy defenses against malicious
/// interpreters. The interpreter is free to structure the state changes however
/// it wants but MUST guard against the calling contract corrupting the changes
/// between `eval` and `set`. For example a store could sandbox storage writes
/// per-caller so that a malicious caller can only damage their own state
/// changes, while honest callers respect, benefit from and are protected by the
/// interpreter store's state change handling.
///
/// The two step eval-state model allows eval to be read-only which provides
/// security guarantees for the caller such as no stateful reentrancy, either
/// from the interpreter or some contract interface used by some word, while
/// still allowing for storage writes. As the storage writes happen on the
/// interpreter rather than the caller (c.f. delegate call) the caller DOES NOT
/// need to trust the interpreter, which allows for permissionless selection of
/// interpreters by end users. Delegate call always implies an admin key on the
/// caller because the delegatee contract can write arbitrarily to the state of

/// collision risk in the packed case as `"abc" + "def"` and `"ab" + "cdef"` will
/// pack and therefore hash to the same values, the suggested fix commonly being
/// to use abi.encode, which includes the lengths disambiguating dynamic data.
/// Something like `3"abc" + 3"def"` with the length prefixes won't collide with
/// `2"ab" + 4"cdef"` but note that ABI provides neither a strong guarantee to
/// be collision resitant on inputs (as far as I know, it's a coincidence that
/// this works), nor an efficient solution.
///
/// - Abi encoding is a complex algorithm that is easily 1k+ gas for simple
///   structs with just one or two dynamic typed fields.
/// - Abi encoding requires allocating and copying all the data plus a header to
///   a new region of memory, which gives it non-linearly increasing costs due to
///   memory expansion.
/// - Abi encoding can't easily be reproduced offchain without specialised tools,
///   it's not simply a matter of length prefixing some byte string and hashing
///   with keccak256, the heads and tails all need to be produced recursively
///   https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html#formal-specification-of-the-encoding
///
/// Consider that `hash(hash("abc") + hash("def"))` won't collide with
/// `hash(hash("ab") + hash("cdef"))`. It should be easier to convince ourselves
/// this is true for all possible pairs of byte strings than it is to convince
/// ourselves that the ABI serialization is never ambigious. Inductively we can
/// scale this to all possible data structures that are ordered compositions of
/// byte strings. Even better, the native behaviour of `keccak256` in the EVM
/// requires no additional allocation of memory. Worst case scenario is that we
/// want to hash several hashes together like `hash(hash0, hash1, ...)`, in which
/// case we can write the words after the free memory pointer, hash them, but
/// leave the pointer. This way we pay for memory expansion but can re-use that
/// region of memory for subsequent logic, which may effectively make the
/// expansion free as we would have needed to pay for it anyway. Given that hash
/// checks often occur early in real world logic due to
/// checks-effects-interactions, this is not an unreasonable assumption to call
/// this kind of expansion "no alloc".
///
/// One problem is that the gas saving for trivial abi encoding,
/// e.g. ~1-3 uint256 values, can be lost by the overhead of jumps and stack
/// manipulation due to function calls.
///
/// ```
/// struct Foo {
///   uint256 a;
///   address b;
///   uint32 c;

///
/// ```
/// assembly ("memory-safe") {
///   hash_ := keccak256(foo_, 0x60)

/// Every struct field is 0x20 bytes in memory so 3 fields = 0x60 bytes to hash
