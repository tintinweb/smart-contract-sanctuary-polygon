 *

 *      1. The user initiates a deposit on the L1 exit by executing the deposit function
 *         `MaticERC20RootTunnel.deposit` or `MaticERC20RootTunnel.depositTo`
 *      2. Polygon messaging system picks up the event emitted by the `deposit` call
 *         and delivers it to L2 chain
 *      3. The deposit completes on the L2 exit when Polygon messaging system executes
 *         the `MaticERC20ChildTunnel.processMessageFromRoot` function
 *      Note: overall, user executes only one function and then just waits for the bridge
 *         operation to complete
 *
 * @notice Withdrawal flow:
 *      1. The user initiates a withdrawal on the L2 exit by executing the withdraw function
 *         `MaticERC20ChildTunnel.withdraw` or `MaticERC20ChildTunnel.withdrawTo`
 *      2. Polygon messaging system picks up the event emitted by the `withdraw` call
 *         and delivers it's proof to L1 chain
 *         This process takes much longer than `deposit` event delivery from L1 to L2 because
 *         of the high L1 gas costs deliveries happen in batches rarely
 *      3. The user completes the withdrawal on the L1 exit by executing the exit function
 *         `MaticERC20RootTunnel.receiveMessage` function
 *         a. Note the difference: the function is executed not by the Polygon messaging system
 *            but by the user themself, L1 gas cost is thus paid by the user
 *         b. The function expects the data from L2 as an input; this data can be obtained

/**
 * @title Access Control List
 *
 * @notice Access control smart contract provides an API to check
 *      if a specific operation is permitted globally and/or
 *      if a particular user has a permission to execute it.
 *
 * @notice It deals with two main entities: features and roles.
 *
 * @notice Features are designed to be used to enable/disable public functions
 *      of the smart contract (used by a wide audience).
 * @notice User roles are designed to control the access to restricted functions
 *      of the smart contract (used by a limited set of maintainers).
 *
 * @notice Terms "role", "permissions" and "set of permissions" have equal meaning
 *      in the documentation text and may be used interchangeably.
 * @notice Terms "permission", "single permission" implies only one permission bit set.
 *
 * @notice Access manager is a special role which allows to grant/revoke other roles.
 *      Access managers can only grant/revoke permissions which they have themselves.
 *      As an example, access manager with no other roles set can only grant/revoke its own
 *      access manager permission and nothing else.
 *
 * @notice Access manager permission should be treated carefully, as a super admin permission:
 *      Access manager with even no other permission can interfere with another account by
 *      granting own access manager permission to it and effectively creating more powerful
 *      permission set than its own.
 *
 * @dev Both current and OpenZeppelin AccessControl implementations feature a similar API
 *      to check/know "who is allowed to do this thing".
 * @dev Zeppelin implementation is more flexible:
 *      - it allows setting unlimited number of roles, while current is limited to 256 different roles
 *      - it allows setting an admin for each role, while current allows having only one global admin
 * @dev Current implementation is more lightweight:
 *      - it uses only 1 bit per role, while Zeppelin uses 256 bits
 *      - it allows setting up to 256 roles at once, in a single transaction, while Zeppelin allows
 *        setting only one role in a single transaction
 *
 * @dev This smart contract is designed to be inherited by other
 *      smart contracts which require access control management capabilities.
 *
 * @dev Access manager permission has a bit 255 set.
 *      This bit must not be used by inheriting contracts for any other permissions/features.

	 *      is about to modify the target permission set          01010101
	 *      Operator wants to set that permission set to          00110011
	 *      Based on their role, an operator has the permissions
	 *      to update only lowest 4 bits on the target, meaning that
	 *      high 4 bits of the target set in this example is left
	 *      unchanged and low 4 bits get changed as desired:      01010011
