 * @notice This TwabController uses the TwabLib to provide token balances and on-chain historical
            lookups to a user(s) time-weighted average balance. Each user is mapped to an
            Account struct containing the TWAB history (ring buffer) and ring buffer parameters.
            Every token.transfer() creates a new TWAB observation. The new TWAB observation is
            stored in the circular ring buffer, as either a new observation or rewriting a
            previous observation with new parameters. One observation per day is stored.
            The TwabLib guarantees minimum 1 year of search history.

 * @dev    Time-Weighted Average Balance Library for ERC20 tokens.
 * @notice This TwabLib adds on-chain historical lookups to a user(s) time-weighted average balance.
 *         Each user is mapped to an Account struct containing the TWAB history (ring buffer) and
 *         ring buffer parameters. Every token.transfer() creates a new TWAB checkpoint. The new
 *         TWAB checkpoint is stored in the circular ring buffer, as either a new checkpoint or
 *         rewriting a previous checkpoint with new parameters. One checkpoint per day is stored.
 *         The TwabLib guarantees minimum 1 year of search history.
