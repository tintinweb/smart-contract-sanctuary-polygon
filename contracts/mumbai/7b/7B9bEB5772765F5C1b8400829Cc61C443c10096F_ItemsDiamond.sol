 * This is an implementation of the Terminus decentralized authorization contract.
 *
 * Terminus users can create authorization pools. Each authorization pool has the following properties:
 * 1. Controller: The address that controls the pool. Initially set to be the address of the pool creator.
 * 2. Pool URI: Metadata URI for the authorization pool.
 * 3. Pool capacity: The total number of tokens that can be minted in that authorization pool.
 * 4. Pool supply: The number of tokens that have actually been minted in that authorization pool.
 * 5. Transferable: A boolean value which denotes whether or not tokens from that pool can be transfered
 *    between addresses. (Note: Implemented by TerminusStorage.poolNotTransferable since we expect most
 *    pools to be transferable. This negation is better for storage + gas since false is default value
 *    in map to bool.)
 * 6. Burnable: A boolean value which denotes whether or not tokens from that pool can be burned.
