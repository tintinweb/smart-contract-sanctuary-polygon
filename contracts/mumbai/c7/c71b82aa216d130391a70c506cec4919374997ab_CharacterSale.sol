/**
 * @dev This is a base abstract contract that tracks voting units, which are a measure of voting power that can be
 * transferred, and provides a system of vote delegation, where an account can delegate its voting units to a sort of
 * "representative" that will pool delegated voting units from different accounts and can then use it to vote in
 * decisions. In fact, voting units _must_ be delegated in order to count as actual votes, and an account has to
 * delegate those votes to itself if it wishes to participate in decisions and does not have a trusted representative.
 *
 * This contract is often combined with a token contract such that voting units correspond to token units. For an
 * example, see {ERC721Votes}.
 *
 * The full history of delegate votes is tracked on-chain so that governance protocols can consider votes as distributed
 * at a particular block number to protect against flash loans and double voting. The opt-in delegate system makes the
 * cost of this history tracking optional.
 *
 * When using this module the derived contract must implement {_getVotingUnits} (for example, make it return
 * {ERC721-balanceOf}), and can use {_transferVotingUnits} to track a change in the distribution of those units (in the
 * previous example, it would be included in {ERC721-_beforeTokenTransfer}).

 *
 * The encoding specified in the EIP is very generic, and such a generic implementation in Solidity is not feasible,
 * thus this contract does not implement the encoding itself. Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding
 * they need in their contracts using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.

 * This contract implements the EIP 712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding
 * scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA
 * ({_hashTypedDataV4}).
 *
 * The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating
 * the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.
 *
 * NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as "v4", as implemented by the JSON RPC method
 * https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask].
 *
 * NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain
 * separator of the implementation contract. This will cause the `_domainSeparatorV4` function to always rebuild the
 * separator from the immutable values, which is cheaper than accessing a cached version in cold storage.
