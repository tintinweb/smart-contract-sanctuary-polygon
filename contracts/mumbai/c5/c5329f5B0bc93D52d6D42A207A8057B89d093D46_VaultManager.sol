 * be inside the GSP, with the only unknown bit being whether or not the
 * vault was created at all (due to not knowing the real GSP state on chain).
 *
 * The contract is an AccountHolder, with the owned account acting as
 * controller for the vaults.  Vaults can be created (and funded in the
 * same transaction), and assets can be sent from vaults to arbitrary users.
 *
 * This contract is deployed stand-alone, but access to write methods (creating
 * vaults and transferring assets from vaults) is restricted to the "owner".
 * This owner will in production be the Democrit trading contract, which
 * utilises the vaults and triggers vault actions.  Note that in contrast
 * to many smart contracts, this "ownership" does not mean that anyone
 * (including the Xaya team) has any special access to user funds!

       at the front and }} at the end, it could lead to attacks actually
       injecting move data for another game into what is, in the end,
       a fully valid JSON move.

       The main thing we need to do for this is ensure that the outermost
       {} brackets of the JSON object are properly matched; the value should
       begin with { and end with }, and while processing the string, there
       should always be at least one level of {} brackets open.  Other brackets
       (i.e. []) are not relevant, because if they are mismatched, it will
       ensure the final JSON value is certainly invalid.

       In addition to that, we need to track string literals well enough to
       ignore any brackets inside of them.  For this, we need to keep track
       of whether or not a string literal is open, and also properly handle
       \" (do not close it) and \\ (if followed by ", it closes the string).

       Any other validation or processing is not necessary.  We also don't have
       to deal with UTF-8 characters in any case (those can be part of
       string literals), as those are cannot interfere with the basic
       control syntax in JSON (which is ASCII).  Any invalid UTF-8 will just
       result in invalid UTF-8 (and thus, and invalid value) in the end.  */
