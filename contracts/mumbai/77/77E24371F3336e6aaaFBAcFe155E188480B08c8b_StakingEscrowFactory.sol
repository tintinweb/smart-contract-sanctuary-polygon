 *
 * This is a trustless, non upgradeable contract. Anyone can create an escrow instance for a vesting wallet. The

 * (to avoid whitelist abuse). The manager will not handle tokens anyway. Manager can be the beneficiary of the

 * Anyone can instantiate an escrow for any vesting contract with any manager. It is ultimately the vesting
 * beneficiary that decide which manager to use when bridging token from the parent chain to the child chain.
 * The manager is the address of an EOA, or a smart wallet on the child chain, that will be the only one authorized
 * to operate on the escrow (see the {StakingEscrow}).
 *
 * Escrow instantiation uses create2 so that they can be deterministically predicted (in particular, by the vesting

/**
 * @dev This is a generic staking contract for the Forta platform. It allows any account to deposit ERC20 tokens to
 * delegate their "power" by staking on behalf of a particular subject. The subject can be scanner, or any other actor
 * in the Forta ecosystem, who need to lock assets in order to contribute to the system.
 *
 * Stakers take risks with their funds, as bad action from a subject can lead to slashing of the funds. In the
 * meantime, stakers are elligible for rewards. Rewards distributed to a particular subject's stakers are distributed
 * following to each staker's share in the subject.
 *
 * Stakers can withdraw their funds, following a withdrawal delay. During the withdrawal delay, funds are no longer
 * counting toward the active stake of a subject, but are still slashable.
 *
 * The SLASHER_ROLE should be given to a future smart contract that will be in charge of resolving disputes.
 *
 * Stakers receive ERC1155 shares in exchange for their stake, making the active stake transferable. When a withdrawal
 * is initiated, similarly the ERC1155 tokens representing the (transferable) active shares are burned in exchange for
 * non-transferable ERC1155 tokens representing the inactive shares.
 *
 * ERC1155 shares representing active stake are transferable, and can be used in an AMM. Their value is however subject
 * to quick devaluation in case of slashing event for the corresponding subject. Thus, trading of such shares should be
 * be done very carefully.
 * 
 * WARNING: To stake from another smart contract (smart contract wallets included), it must be fully ERC1155 compatible,
 * implementing ERC1155Receiver. If not, minting of active and inactive shares will fail.
 * Do not deposit on the constructor if you don't implement ERC1155Receiver. During the construction, the minting will
 * succeed but you will not be able to withdraw or mint new shares from the contract. If this happens, transfer your
 * shares to an EOA or fully ERC1155 compatible contract.

 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using

 * @dev Extension of ERC20 to support Compound-like voting and delegation. This version is more generic than Compound's,

 * This extension keeps a history (checkpoints) of each account's vote power. Vote power can be delegated either

 * power can be queried through the public accessors {getVotes} and {getPastVotes}.

 * By default, token balance does not account for voting power. This makes transfers cheaper. The downside is that it
 * requires users to delegate to themselves in order to activate checkpoints and have their voting power tracked.
 * Enabling self-delegation can easily be done by overriding the {delegates} function. Keep in mind however that this
 * will significantly increase the base gas cost of transfers.

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since a proxied contract can't have a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the
 * initializer manually, or you can include a constructor to automatically mark it as initialized when it is deployed:
