/**
 * @dev Implementation of the `IERC20` interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using `_mint`.
 * For a generic mechanism see `ERC20Mintable`.
 *
 * *For a detailed writeup see our guide [How to implement supply
 * mechanisms](https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226).*
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * transferAndCall
 *
 * Additionally, an `Approval` event is emitted on calls to `transferFrom`.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
