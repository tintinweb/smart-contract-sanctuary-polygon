library TypedMemView {

    // Why does this exist?
    // the solidity `bytes memory` type has a few weaknesses.
    // 1. You can't index ranges effectively
    // 2. You can't slice without copying
    // 3. The underlying data may represent any type
    // 4. Solidity never deallocates memory, and memory costs grow
    //    superlinearly

    // By using a memory view instead of a `bytes memory` we get the following
    // advantages:
    // 1. Slices are done on the stack, by manipulating the pointer
    // 2. We can index arbitrary ranges and quickly convert them to stack types
    // 3. We can insert type info into the pointer, and typecheck at runtime

    // This makes `TypedMemView` a useful tool for efficient zero-copy
    // algorithms.

    // Why bytes29?
    // We want to avoid confusion between views, digests, and other common
    // types so we chose a large and uncommonly used odd number of bytes
    //
    // Note that while bytes are left-aligned in a word, integers and addresses
    // are right-aligned. This means when working in assembly we have to
    // account for the 3 unused bytes on the righthand side
    //
    // First 5 bytes are a type flag.
    // - ff_ffff_fffe is reserved for unknown type.
    // - ff_ffff_ffff is reserved for invalid types/errors.
    // next 12 are memory address
    // next 12 are len
    // bottom 3 bytes are empty

    // Assumptions:
    // - non-modification of memory.
    // - No Solidity updates
    // - - wrt free mem point
    // - - wrt bytes representation in memory
    // - - wrt memory addressing in general

    // Usage:
    // - create type constants
    // - use `assertType` for runtime type assertions
    // - - unfortunately we can't do this at compile time yet :(
    // - recommended: implement modifiers that perform type checking
    // - - e.g.
    // - - `uint40 constant MY_TYPE = 3;`
    // - - ` modifer onlyMyType(bytes29 myView) { myView.assertType(MY_TYPE); }`
    // - instantiate a typed view from a bytearray using `ref`
    // - use `index` to inspect the contents of the view
    // - use `slice` to create smaller views into the same memory
    // - - `slice` can increase the offset
    // - - `slice can decrease the length`
    // - - must specify the output type of `slice`
    // - - `slice` will return a null view if you try to overrun
    // - - make sure to explicitly check for this with `notNull` or `assertType`
    // - use `equal` for typed comparisons.
