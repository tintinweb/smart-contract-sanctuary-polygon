 *        approve transactions. Managed in `OwnerManager`.
 *      - Transaction Hash: Hash of a transaction is calculated using the EIP-712 typed structured data hashing scheme.
 *      - Nonce: Each transaction should have a different nonce to prevent replay attacks.
 *      - Signature: A valid signature of an owner of the Safe for a transaction hash.
 *      - Guard: Guard is a contract that can execute pre- and post- transaction checks. Managed in `GuardManager`.
 *      - Modules: Modules are contracts that can be used to extend the write functionality of a Safe. Managed in `ModuleManager`.
 *      - Fallback: Fallback handler is a contract that can provide additional read-only functional for Safe. Managed in `FallbackManager`.
 *      Note: This version of the implementation contract doesn't emit events for the sake of gas efficiency and therefore requires a tracing node for indexing/

/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
