 * @dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access
 * control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role
 * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some
 * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see
 * {AccessControlEnumerable}.
 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed
 * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by
 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a
 * function call, use {hasRole}:
 *
 * ```
 * function foo() public {
 *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
 *
 * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
 * accounts that have been granted it.

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();

 * @dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access
 * control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role
 * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some
 * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see
 * {AccessControlEnumerable}.
 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed
 * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by
 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a
 * function call, use {hasRole}:
 *
 * ```
 * function foo() public {
 *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
 *
 * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
 * accounts that have been granted it.

///
/// @notice During phase 1, accepts USDT or Virtual TAL, which is automatically
///   converted into an equivalent TAL amount.
///   Once phase 2 starts (after a TAL address has been set), only TAL deposits are accepted
///
/// @notice StakingV3:
///   Each stake results in minting a set supply of the corresponding talent token
///   Talent tokens are immediately transfered to the staker, and TAL is locked into the stake
///
/// @notice Checkpoints:
///   Any action on a stake triggers a checkpoint. Checkpoints accumulate
///   all rewards since the last checkpoint until now. A new stake amount is
///   calculated, and reward calculation starts again from the checkpoint's
///   timestamp.
///
/// @notice Unstaking:
///   By sending back an amount of talent token, you can recover an amount of
///   TAL previously staked (or earned through staking rewards), in proportion to
///   your stake and amount of talent tokens. e.g.: if you have a stake of 110 TAL
///   and have minted 2 Talent Tokens, sending 1 Talent Token gets you 55 TAL back.
///   This process also burns the sent Talent Token
///
/// @notice Re-stake:
///   Stakers can at any moment strengthen their position by sending in more TAL to an existing stake.
///   This will cause a checkpoint, accumulate rewards in the virtual TAL wallet, and mint new Talent Token
///
/// @notice Claim rewards:
///   Stakers can, at any moment, claim whatever rewards are pending from their stake.
///   Rewards are only calculated from the moment of their last checkpoint.
///   Claiming rewards adds the calculated amount of TAL to the staker virtual TAL wallet
///
/// @notice Withdraw rewards:
///   Stakers can, at any moment, claim whatever rewards are pending from their stake.
///   Rewards are only calculated from the moment of their last checkpoint.
///   Withdrawing rewards sends the calculated amount of TAL to the staker's wallet.
///   No Talent Token is minted in this scenario
///
/// @notice Rewards:
///   given based on the logic from `RewardCalculatorV2`, which
///   relies on a continuous `totalAdjustedShares` being updated on every
///   stake/withdraw. See `RewardCalculatorV2` for more details
///
/// @notice Disabling staking:
///   The team reserves the ability to halt staking & reward accumulation,
///   to use if the tokenomics model or contracts don't work as expected, and need to be rethough.
///   In this event, any pending rewards must still be valid and redeemable by stakers.
///   New stakes must not be allowed, and existing stakes will not accumulate new rewards past the disabling block
///
/// @notice Withdrawing remaining rewards:
///   If staking is disabled, or if the end timestamp has been reached, the team can then
///   intervene on stakes to accumulate their rewards on their behalf, in order to reach an `activeStakes` count of 0.
///   Once 0 is reached, since no more claims will ever be made,
///   the remaining TAL from the reward pool can be safely withdrawn back to the team
