 * @title PremiumGenerator contract
 * @author smeee
 * This is a contract for lossless insurance premiums using Aave v3

   Aave is used to generate interest for insurance applications

   Beneficiaries deposit tokens into PremiumGenerator which deposit
   them into Aave lending protocol

   The interest earned is directed to the reserve associated with
   the PremiumGenerator

   Beneficiaries can claim their funds (and terminate their policy) at any time.

   Functions withdraw() and withdrawInterest() directly call the aave Pool

 * @dev To be covered by a proxy contract
