 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}

/**
 * A sample paymaster that defines itself as a token to pay for gas.
 * The paymaster IS the token to use, since a paymaster cannot use an external contract.
 * Also, the exchange rate has to be fixed, since it can't reference an external Uniswap or other exchange contract.
 * subclass should override "getTokenValueOfEth" to provide actual token exchange rate, settable by the owner.
 * Known Limitation: this paymaster is exploitable when put into a batch with multiple ops (of different accounts):
 * - while a single op can't exploit the paymaster (if postOp fails to withdraw the tokens, the user's op is reverted,
 *   and then we know we can withdraw the tokens), multiple ops with different senders (all using this paymaster)
 *   in a batch can withdraw funds from 2nd and further ops, forcing the paymaster itself to pay (from its deposit)
 * - Possible workarounds are either use a more complex paymaster scheme (e.g. the DepositPaymaster) or
 *   to whitelist the account and the called method ids.
