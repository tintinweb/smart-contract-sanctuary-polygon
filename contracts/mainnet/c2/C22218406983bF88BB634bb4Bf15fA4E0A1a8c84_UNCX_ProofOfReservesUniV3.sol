/*
    The UNCX Proof of Reserves V3 Contract locks any exact fork of Uniswap V3's liquidity NFT's in this contract.
    Proof of reserves means a user is aware that a pools liquidity cannot be removed until the time lock expires.
    Proof of reserves prevents hacks of founders wallets from comprimising this important aspect of their tokens ecosystem.

    Since liquidity means so much to all ecosystem participants, this contract converts a UniV3 position to full range, from the absolute 
    minimum lowerTick to the absolute maximum upperTick, creating a reliable pool where tokens will be tradeable at any price.

    Lock owners are still free to collect fees as they please, and add liquidity to their position, while the liquidity remains locked.

    You can also still view your NFT and its metrics on uniswap while it is locked. e.g. https://app.uniswap.org/#/pools/69
