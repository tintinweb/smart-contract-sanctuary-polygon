/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }

/**
 * @title Instant Distribution Agreement interface
 * @author Superfluid
 *
 * @notice 
 *   - A publisher can create as many as indices as possibly identifiable with `indexId`.
 *     - `indexId` is deliberately limited to 32 bits, to avoid the chance for sha-3 collision.
 *       Despite knowing sha-3 collision is only theoretical.
 *   - A publisher can create a subscription to an index for any subscriber.
 *   - A subscription consists of:
 *     - The index it subscribes to.
 *     - Number of units subscribed.
 *   - An index consists of:
 *     - Current value as `uint128 indexValue`.
 *     - Total units of the approved subscriptions as `uint128 totalUnitsApproved`.
 *     - Total units of the non approved subscription as `uint128 totalUnitsPending`.
 *   - A publisher can update an index with a new value that doesn't decrease.
 *   - A publisher can update a subscription with any number of units.
 *   - A publisher or a subscriber can delete a subscription and reset its units to zero.
 *   - A subscriber must approve the index in order to receive distributions from the publisher
 *     each time the index is updated.
 *     - The amount distributed is $$\Delta{index} * units$$
 *   - Distributions to a non approved subscription stays in the publisher's deposit until:
 *     - the subscriber approves the subscription (side effect),
 *     - the publisher updates the subscription (side effect),
 *     - the subscriber deletes the subscription even if it is never approved (side effect),
 *     - or the subscriber can explicitly claim them.
