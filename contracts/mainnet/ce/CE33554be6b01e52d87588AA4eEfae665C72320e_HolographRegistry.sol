 its contribution or any derivative works that you create.
 B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license,
 including the license conditions and limitations in section 3,
 each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,

 dispose of its contribution in the software or derivative works
 of the contribution in the software.

 3. Conditions and Limitations

 A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights
 to use any contributors’ name, logo, or trademarks.
 B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over
 patents that you claim are infringed by the software, your

 code form, you may only do so under a license that complies
 with this license.
 E) The software is licensed “as-is.” You bear all risks of
 using it. The contributors give no express warranties,
 guarantees, or conditions. You may have additional consumer
 rights under your local laws which this license cannot change.
 To the extent permitted under your local laws, the contributors
