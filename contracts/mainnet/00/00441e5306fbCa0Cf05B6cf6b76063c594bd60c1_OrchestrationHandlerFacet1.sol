     * Limitation of the method:
     * If chosen dispute resolver has seller allow list, this method will not succeed, since seller that will be created
     * cannot be on that list. To avoid the failure you can
     * - Choose a dispute resolver without seller allow list
     * - Make an absolute zero offer without and dispute resolver specified
     * - First create a seller {AccountHandler.createSeller}, make sure that dispute resolver adds seller to its allow list
     *   and then continue with the offer creation
     *
     * Emits a SellerCreated, an OfferCreated and a RangeReserved event if successful.
