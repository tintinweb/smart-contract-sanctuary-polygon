/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();

/**
Allow qualified users to participate in a sale according to sale rules.

Management
- the address that deploys the sale is the sale owner
- owners may change some sale parameters (e.g. start and end times)
- sale proceeds are sent to the sale recipient

Qualification
- public sale: anyone can participate
- private sale: only users who can prove membership in a merkle tree can participate

Sale Rules
- timing: purchases can only be made
  - after the sale opens
  - after the per-account random queue time has elapsed
  - before the sale ends
- purchase quantity: quantity is limited by
  - per-address limit
  - total sale limit
- payment method: participants can pay using either
  - the native token on the network (e.g. ETH)
  - a single ERC-20 token (e.g. USDC)
- number of purchases: there is no limit to the number of compliant purchases a user may make

Token Distribution
- this contract does not distribute any purchased tokens

Metrics
- purchase count: number of purchases made in this sale
- user count: number of unique addresses that participated in this sale
- total bought: value of purchases denominated in a base currency (e.g. USD) as an integer (to get the float value, divide by oracle decimals)
- bought per user: value of a user's purchases denominated in a base currency (e.g. USD)

total bought and bought per user metrics are inclusive of any fee charged (if a fee is charged, the sale recipient will receive less than the total spend)
