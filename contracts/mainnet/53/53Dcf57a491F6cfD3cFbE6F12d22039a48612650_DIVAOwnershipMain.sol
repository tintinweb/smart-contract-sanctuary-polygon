/**
 * @notice Contract that stores the DIVA owner and implements a decentralized mechanism (a so-called
 * decentralized protocol takeover mechanism) to elect a new owner.
 * The reason for outsourcing the owner logic into a separate contract allows the owner to inherit all
 * future versions of DIVA protocol and other related contracts by referencing this contract.
 * The owner election logic is specific to the main chain. Tellor protocol is used to communicate
 * the owner to secondary chains.
 * 
 * Decentralized protocol takeover mechanism:
 * The owner is elected by DIVA Token holders which express their support for a candidate (incl. current owner) 
 * by staking DIVA tokens towards that candidate. If a candidate accumulates more stake than the current owner,
 * they can trigger an election cycle which is split into the following two successive periods:
 *   1. Showdown period (30 days): DIVA token holders continue to stake/unstake during that period to express
 *   their support for their preferred candidate. At the end of the period, a snapshot of the stakes is taken
 *   via a manual ownership claim submission process (see second period below) which determines the outcome of the
 *   election cycle.
 *   2. Ownership claim submission period (7 days): any candidate that has a higher stake than the current owner
 *   can submit a claim on the ownership by calling the `submitOwnershipClaim` function. 
 *   Staking/unstaking are disabled during that period. This manual ownership claim submission process has been
 *   implemented to avoid costly max calculations / loops inside the smart contract.
