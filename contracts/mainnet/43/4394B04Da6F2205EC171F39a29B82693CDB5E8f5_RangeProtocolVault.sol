/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * @dev [email protected]
 * @notice RangeProtocolVault is fungible vault shares contract that accepts algebra pool tokens for liquidity
 * provision to the corresponding algebra pool. This contract is configurable to work with any algebra
 * pool and is initialized through RangeProtocolFactory contract's createVault function which determines
 * the pool address based provided tokens addresses and fee tier.
 *
 * The contract allows minting and burning of vault shares where minting involves providing token0 and/or token1
 * for the current set ticks (or based on ratio of token0 and token1 amounts in the vault when vault does not have an
 * active position in the algebra pool) and burning involves removing liquidity from the algebra pool along with
 * the vault's fee.
 *
 * The manager of the contract can remove liquidity from algebra pool and deposit into a newer take range to maximise
 * the profit by keeping liquidity out of the pool under high volatility periods.
 *
 * Part of the fee earned from algebra position is paid to manager as performance fee and fee is charged on the LP's
 * notional amount as managing fee.
