 * @notice A factory contract through which new borrowing vaults are created.
 * The BorrowingVault contract is quite big in size. Creating new instances of it with
 * `new BorrowingVault()` makes the factory contract exceed the 24K limit. That's why
 * we use an approach found at Fraxlend. We split and store the BorrowingVault bytecode
 * in two different locations and when used they get concatanated and deployed by using assembly.
