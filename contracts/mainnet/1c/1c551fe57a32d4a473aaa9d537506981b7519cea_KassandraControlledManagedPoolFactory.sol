/**
 * @title Circuit Breaker Storage Library
 * @notice Library for storing and manipulating state related to circuit breakers.
 * @dev The intent of circuit breakers is to halt trading of a given token if its value changes drastically -
 * in either direction - with respect to other tokens in the pool. For instance, a stablecoin might de-peg
 * and go to zero. With no safeguards, arbitrageurs could drain the pool by selling large amounts of the
 * token to the pool at inflated internal prices.
 *
 * The circuit breaker mechanism establishes a "safe trading range" for each token, expressed in terms of
 * the BPT price. Both lower and upper bounds can be set, and if a trade would result in moving the BPT price
 * of any token involved in the operation outside that range, the breaker is "tripped", and the operation
 * should revert. Each token is independent, since some might have very "tight" valid trading ranges, such as
 * stablecoins, and others are more volatile.
 *
 * The BPT price of a token is defined as the amount of BPT that could be redeemed for a single token.
 * For instance, in an 80/20 pool with a total supply of 1000, the 80% token accounts for 800 BPT. So each
 * token would be worth 800 / token balance. The formula is then: total supply * token weight / token balance.
 * (Note that this only applies *if* the pool is balanced (a condition that cannot be checked by the pool without
 * accessing price oracles.)
 *
 * We need to use the BPT price as the measure to ensure we account for the change relative to the rest of
 * the pool, which could have many other tokens. The drop detected by circuit breakers is analogous to
 * impermanent loss: it is relative to the performance of the other tokens. If the entire market tanks and
 * all token balances go down together, the *relative* change would be zero, and the breaker would not be
 * triggered: even though the external price might have dropped 50 or 70%. It is only the *relative* movement
 * compared to the rest of the pool that matters.
 *
 * If we have tokens A, B, and C, If A drops 20% and B and C are unchanged, that's a simple 20% drop for A.
 * However, if A is unchanged and C increases 25%, that would also be a 20% "drop" for A 1 / 1.25 = 0.8.
 * The breaker might register a 20% drop even if both go up - if our target token lags the market. For
 * instance, if A goes up 60% and B and C double, 1.6 / 2 = 0.8.
 *
 * Since BPT prices are not intuitive - and there is a very non-linear relationship between "spot" prices and
 * BPT prices - circuit breakers are set using simple percentages. Intuitively, a lower bound of 0.8 means the
 * token can lose 20% of its value before triggering the circuit breaker, and an upper bound of 3.0 means it
 * can triple before being halted. These percentages are then transformed into BPT prices for comparison to the
 * "reference" state of the pool when the circuit breaker was set.
 *
 * Prices can change in two ways: arbitrage traders responding to external price movement can change the balances,
 * or an ongoing gradual weight update (or change in pool composition) can change the weights. In order to isolate
 * the balance changes due to price movement, the bounds are dynamic, adjusted for the current weight.

     * @notice Returns a dynamic lower or upper BPT price bound for a given token, at the current weight.
     * @dev The current BPT price of the token can be directly compared to this value, to determine whether
     * the breaker should be tripped. If a bound is 0, it means there is no circuit breaker in that direction
     * for this token: there might be a lower bound, but no upper bound. If the current BPT price is less than
     * the lower bound, or greater than the non-zero upper bound, the transaction should revert.
     *
     * These BPT price bounds are dynamically adjusted by a non-linear factor dependent on the weight.
     * In general: lower/upper BPT price bound = bptPrice * "weight adjustment". The weight adjustment is
     * given as: (boundaryPercentage)**(1 - weight).
     *
     * For instance, given the 80/20 BAL/WETH pool with a 90% lower bound, the weight complement would be
     * (1 - 0.8) = 0.2, so the lower adjusted bound would be (0.9 ** 0.2) ~ 0.9791. For the WETH token at 20%,
     * the bound would be (0.9 ** 0.8) ~ 0.9192.
     *
     * With unequal weights (assuming a balanced pool), the balance of a higher-weight token will respond less
     * to a proportional change in spot price than a lower weight token, which we might call "balance inertia".
     *
     * If the external price drops, all else being equal, the pool would be arbed until the percent drop in spot
     * price equaled the external price drop. Since during this process the *internal* pool price would be
     * above market, the arbers would sell cheap tokens to our poor unwitting pool at inflated prices, raising
     * the balance of the depreciating token, and lowering the balance of another token (WETH in this example).
     *
     * Using weighted math, and assuming for simplicity that the sum of all weights is 1, you can compute the
     * amountIn ratio for the arb trade as: (1/priceRatio) ** (1 - weight). For our 0.9 ratio and a weight of
     * 0.8, this is ~ 1.0213. So if you had 8000 tokens before, the ending balance would be 8000*1.0213 ~ 8170.
     * Note that the higher the weight, the lower this ratio is. That means the counterparty token is going
     * out proportionally faster than the arb token is coming in: hence the non-linear relationship between
     * spot price and BPT price.
     *
     * If we call the initial balance B0, and set k = (1/priceRatio) ** (1 - weight), the post-arb balance is
     * given by: B1 = k * B0. Since the BPTPrice0 = totalSupply*weight/B0, and BPTPrice1 = totalSupply*weight/B1,
     * we can combine these equations to compute the BPT price ratio BPTPrice1/BPTPrice0 = 1/k; BPT1 = BPT0/k.
     * So we see that the "conversion factor" between the spot price ratio and BPT Price ratio can be written
     * as above BPT1 = BPT0 * (1/k), or more simply: (BPT price) * (priceRatio)**(1 - weight).
     *
     * Another way to think of it is in terms of "BPT Value". Assuming a balanced pool, a token with a weight
     * of 80% represents 80% of the value of the BPT. An uncorrelated drop in that token's value would drop
     * the value of LP shares much faster than a similar drop in the value of a 20% token. Whatever the value
     * of the bound percentage, as the adjustment factor - B ** (1 - weight) - approaches 1, less adjustment
     * is necessary: it tracks the relative price movement more closely. Intuitively, this is wny we use the
     * complement of the weight. Higher weight = lower exponent = adjustment factor closer to 1.0 = "faster"
     * tracking of value changes.
     *
     * If the value of the weight has not changed, we can use the cached adjusted bounds stored when the breaker
     * was set. Otherwise, we need to calculate them.
     *
     * As described in the general comments above, the weight adjustment calculation attempts to isolate changes
     * in the balance due to arbitrageurs responding to external prices, from internal price changes caused by
     * weight changes. There is a non-linear relationship between "spot" price changes and BPT price changes.
     * This calculation transforms one into the other.

    // Swaps
    //
    // Users can swap tokens with Pools by calling the `swap` and `batchSwap` functions. To do this,
    // they need not trust Pool contracts in any way: all security checks are made by the Vault. They must however be
    // aware of the Pools' pricing algorithms in order to estimate the prices Pools will quote.
    //
    // The `swap` function executes a single swap, while `batchSwap` can perform multiple swaps in sequence.
    // In each individual swap, tokens of one kind are sent from the sender to the Pool (this is the 'token in'),
    // and tokens of another kind are sent from the Pool to the recipient in exchange (this is the 'token out').
    // More complex swaps, such as one token in to multiple tokens out can be achieved by batching together
    // individual swaps.
    //
    // There are two swap kinds:
    //  - 'given in' swaps, where the amount of tokens in (sent to the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines (via the
    // `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens out (to send to the recipient).
    //  - 'given out' swaps, where the amount of tokens out (received from the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines
    // (via the `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens in (to receive from the sender).
    //
    // Additionally, it is possible to chain swaps using a placeholder input amount, which the Vault replaces with
    // the calculated output of the previous swap. If the previous swap was 'given in', this will be the calculated
    // tokenOut amount. If the previous swap was 'given out', it will use the calculated tokenIn amount. These extended
    // swaps are known as 'multihop' swaps, since they 'hop' through a number of intermediate tokens before arriving at
    // the final intended token.
    //
    // In all cases, tokens are only transferred in and out of the Vault (or withdrawn from and deposited into Internal
    // Balance) after all individual swaps have been completed, and the net token balance change computed. This makes
    // certain swap patterns, such as multihops, or swaps that interact with the same token pair in multiple Pools, cost
    // much less gas than they would otherwise.
    //
    // It also means that under certain conditions it is possible to perform arbitrage by swapping with multiple
    // Pools in a way that results in net token movement out of the Vault (profit), with no tokens being sent in (only
    // updating the Pool's internal accounting).
    //
    // To protect users from front-running or the market changing rapidly, they supply a list of 'limits' for each token
    // involved in the swap, where either the maximum number of tokens to send (by passing a positive value) or the
    // minimum amount of tokens to receive (by passing a negative value) is specified.
    //
    // Additionally, a 'deadline' timestamp can also be provided, forcing the swap to fail if it occurs after
    // this point in time (e.g. if the transaction failed to be included in a block promptly).
    //
    // If interacting with Pools that hold WETH, it is possible to both send and receive ETH directly: the Vault will do
    // the wrapping and unwrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be
    // passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address. Note that it is possible to combine ETH and WETH in the
    // same swap. Any excess ETH will be sent back to the caller (not the sender, which is relevant for relayers).
    //
    // Finally, Internal Balance can be used when either sending or receiving tokens.

    // Pools are expected to keep track of how much they have charged in swap fees, and pay any outstanding debts to the
    // Vault when they are joined or exited. This prevents users from joining a Pool with unpaid debt, as well as
    // exiting a Pool in debt without first paying their share.

 *
 * Recovery Mode is *not* the same as pausing the pool. The pause function is only available during a short window

 * will permanently unpause itself thereafter. Paused pools are completely disabled, in a kind of suspended animation,
 * until they are voluntarily or involuntarily unpaused.
 *
 * By contrast, a privileged account - typically a governance multisig - can place a pool in Recovery Mode at any
 * time, and it is always reversible. The pool is *not* disabled while in this mode: though of course whatever
 * condition prompted the transition to Recovery Mode has likely effectively disabled some functions. Rather,
 * a special "clean" exit is enabled, which runs the absolute minimum code necessary to exit proportionally.
 * In particular, stable pools do not attempt to compute the invariant (which is a complex, iterative calculation
 * that can fail in extreme circumstances), and no protocol fees are collected.
 *
 * It is critical to ensure that turning on Recovery Mode would do no harm, if activated maliciously or in error.
