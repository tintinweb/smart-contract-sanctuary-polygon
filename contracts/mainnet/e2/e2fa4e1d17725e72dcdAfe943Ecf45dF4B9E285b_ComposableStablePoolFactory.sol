    // a boolean value: in these scenarios, a non-reverting call is assumed to be successful.
    //
    // - All non-view functions in the Vault are non-reentrant: calling them while another one is mid-execution (e.g.
    // while execution control is transferred to a token contract during a swap) will result in a revert. View
    // functions can be called in a re-reentrant way, but doing so might cause them to return inconsistent results.

     *
     * If the caller is not `sender`, it must be an authorized relayer for them.
     *
     * The `tokens` and `minAmountsOut` arrays must have the same length, and each entry in these indicates the minimum
     * token amount to receive for each token contract. The amounts to send are decided by the Pool and not the Vault:
     * it just enforces these minimums.
     *
     * If exiting a Pool that holds WETH, it is possible to receive ETH directly: the Vault will do the unwrapping. To
     * enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be passed in the `assets` array instead
     * of the WETH address. Note that it is not possible to combine ETH and WETH in the same exit.
     *
     * `assets` must have the same length and order as the array returned by `getPoolTokens`. This prevents issues when
     * interacting with Pools that register and deregister tokens frequently. If receiving ETH however, the array must
     * be sorted *before* replacing the WETH address with the ETH sentinel value (the zero address), which means the
     * final `assets` array might not be sorted. Pools with no registered tokens cannot be exited.
     *
     * If `toInternalBalance` is true, the tokens will be deposited to `recipient`'s Internal Balance. Otherwise,
     * an ERC20 transfer will be performed. Note that ETH cannot be deposited to Internal Balance: attempting to
     * do so will trigger a revert.
     *
     * `minAmountsOut` is the minimum amount of tokens the user expects to get out of the Pool, for each token in the
     * `tokens` array. This array must match the Pool's registered tokens.
     *
     * This causes the Vault to call the `IBasePool.onExitPool` hook on the Pool's contract, where Pools implement
     * their own custom logic. This typically requires additional information from the user (such as the expected number
     * of Pool shares to return). This can be encoded in the `userData` argument, which is ignored by the Vault and
     * passed directly to the Pool's contract.

    // Swaps
    //
    // Users can swap tokens with Pools by calling the `swap` and `batchSwap` functions. To do this,
    // they need not trust Pool contracts in any way: all security checks are made by the Vault. They must however be
    // aware of the Pools' pricing algorithms in order to estimate the prices Pools will quote.
    //
    // The `swap` function executes a single swap, while `batchSwap` can perform multiple swaps in sequence.
    // In each individual swap, tokens of one kind are sent from the sender to the Pool (this is the 'token in'),
    // and tokens of another kind are sent from the Pool to the recipient in exchange (this is the 'token out').
    // More complex swaps, such as one token in to multiple tokens out can be achieved by batching together
    // individual swaps.
    //
    // There are two swap kinds:
    //  - 'given in' swaps, where the amount of tokens in (sent to the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines (via the
    // `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens out (to send to the recipient).
    //  - 'given out' swaps, where the amount of tokens out (received from the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines
    // (via the `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens in (to receive from the sender).
    //
    // Additionally, it is possible to chain swaps using a placeholder input amount, which the Vault replaces with
    // the calculated output of the previous swap. If the previous swap was 'given in', this will be the calculated
    // tokenOut amount. If the previous swap was 'given out', it will use the calculated tokenIn amount. These extended
    // swaps are known as 'multihop' swaps, since they 'hop' through a number of intermediate tokens before arriving at
    // the final intended token.
    //
    // In all cases, tokens are only transferred in and out of the Vault (or withdrawn from and deposited into Internal
    // Balance) after all individual swaps have been completed, and the net token balance change computed. This makes
    // certain swap patterns, such as multihops, or swaps that interact with the same token pair in multiple Pools, cost
    // much less gas than they would otherwise.
    //
    // It also means that under certain conditions it is possible to perform arbitrage by swapping with multiple
    // Pools in a way that results in net token movement out of the Vault (profit), with no tokens being sent in (only
    // updating the Pool's internal accounting).
    //
    // To protect users from front-running or the market changing rapidly, they supply a list of 'limits' for each token
    // involved in the swap, where either the maximum number of tokens to send (by passing a positive value) or the
    // minimum amount of tokens to receive (by passing a negative value) is specified.
    //
    // Additionally, a 'deadline' timestamp can also be provided, forcing the swap to fail if it occurs after
    // this point in time (e.g. if the transaction failed to be included in a block promptly).
    //
    // If interacting with Pools that hold WETH, it is possible to both send and receive ETH directly: the Vault will do
    // the wrapping and unwrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be
    // passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address. Note that it is possible to combine ETH and WETH in the
    // same swap. Any excess ETH will be sent back to the caller (not the sender, which is relevant for relayers).
    //
    // Finally, Internal Balance can be used when either sending or receiving tokens.

/**
 * @dev StablePool with preminted BPT and rate providers for each token, allowing for e.g. wrapped tokens with a known
 * price ratio, such as Compound's cTokens.
 *
 * BPT is preminted on Pool initialization and registered as one of the Pool's tokens, allowing for swaps to behave as
 * single-token joins or exits (by swapping a token for BPT). We also support regular joins and exits, which can mint
 * and burn BPT.
 *
 * Preminted BPT is deposited in the Vault as the initial balance of the Pool, and doesn't belong to any entity until
 * transferred out of the Pool. The Pool's arithmetic behaves as if it didn't exist, and the BPT total supply is not
 * a useful value: we rely on the 'virtual supply' (how much BPT is actually owned outside the Vault) instead.

     * e.g. proportional joins), or grows faster and shrinks more slowly than it (whenever swap fees are collected or
     * the token rates increase). Therefore, the rate is a monotonically increasing function.

     * via reentrancy if called within a Vault context (i.e. in the middle of a join or an exit). It is up to the
     * caller to ensure that the function is safe to call.
     *
     * This may happen e.g. if one of the tokens in the Pool contains some form of callback behavior in the
     * `transferFrom` function (like ERC777 tokens do). These tokens are strictly incompatible with the
     * Vault and Pool design, and are not safe to be used.
     *
     * There are also other situations where calling this function is unsafe. See

 * useful for slow changing rates, such as those that arise from interest-bearing tokens (e.g. waDAI into DAI).
 *
 * The cache data is packed into a single bytes32 value with the following structure:
 * [ 32 bits |  32 bits  |  96 bits  |    96 bits    ]
 * [ expires | duration  | old rate  | current rate  ]
 * |MSB                                           LSB|
 *
 * 'rate' is an 18 decimal fixed point number, supporting rates of up to ~3e10. 'expires' is a Unix timestamp, and
 * 'duration' is expressed in seconds.

 * @notice Reference implementation for the base layer of a Pool contract.
 * @dev Reference implementation for the base layer of a Pool contract that manages a single Pool with optional
 * Asset Managers, an admin-controlled swap fee percentage, and an emergency pause mechanism.
 *
 * This Pool pays protocol fees by minting BPT directly to the ProtocolFeeCollector instead of using the
 * `dueProtocolFees` return value. This results in the underlying tokens continuing to provide liquidity
 * for traders, while still keeping gas usage to a minimum since only a single token (the BPT) is transferred.
 *
 * Note that neither swap fees nor the pause mechanism are used by this contract. They are passed through so that
 * derived contracts can use them via the `_addSwapFeeAmount` and `_subtractSwapFeeAmount` functions, and the
 * `whenNotPaused` modifier.
 *
 * No admin permissions are checked here: instead, this contract delegates that to the Vault's own Authorizer.
 *
 * Because this contract doesn't implement the swap hooks, derived contracts should generally inherit from
 * BaseGeneralPool or BaseMinimalSwapInfoPool. Otherwise, subclasses must inherit from the corresponding interfaces
 * and implement the swap callbacks themselves.

 * will permanently unpause itself thereafter. Paused pools are completely disabled, in a kind of suspended animation,
 * until they are voluntarily or involuntarily unpaused.
 *
 * By contrast, a privileged account - typically a governance multisig - can place a pool in Recovery Mode at any
 * time, and it is always reversible. The pool is *not* disabled while in this mode: though of course whatever
 * condition prompted the transition to Recovery Mode has likely effectively disabled some functions. Rather,
 * a special "clean" exit is enabled, which runs the absolute minimum code necessary to exit proportionally.
 * In particular, stable pools do not attempt to compute the invariant (which is a complex, iterative calculation
 * that can fail in extreme circumstances), and no protocol fees are collected.

 * This contract implements the EIP 712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding
 * scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA
 * ({_hashTypedDataV4}).
 *
 * The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating
 * the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.
 *
 * NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as "v4", as implemented by the JSON RPC method
