/**
 * @title TokenTransferRelay
 * @dev TokenTransferRelay smart contract implements a two-step token transfer service that allows for refundable token transfers.
 * Each contract instance can relay only one ERC20 / ERC721 tokens per deployment.
 *
 * ERC20 / ERC721 token transfers can be reserved by a token holder, by calling the `reserveTransfer` function.
 * This places the token holder's funds in escrow, allowing for later execution, or refund of the transfer.
 *
 * Calling `executeTransfer` executes a reserved token transfer, relaying the funds under escrow to either ERC721Receiver, or ERC20Receiver.
 * Alternatively, a reserved transfer can be refunded back to the original token holder by calling `revertTransfer`. Only accounts
 * granted OPERATOR_ROLE can call this function.
 *
 * The token holder must always give the necessary approval and allowance to the contract for it to manage their funds.
 *
 * The contract also provides the option to reserve and execute token transfers on behalf of a token holder by using
 * the `reserveTransferFrom` and `executeTransferFrom` functions, respectively.
 *
 * The ERC721Receiver and ERC20Receiver addresses can be configured by accounts granted MAINTENANCE_ROLE.
