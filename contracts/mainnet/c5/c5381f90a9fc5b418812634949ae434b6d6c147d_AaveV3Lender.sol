 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.

 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means

 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

 * @title YearnV3 Base Tokenized Strategy
 * @author yearn.finance
 * @notice
 *  BaseTokenizedStrategy implements all of the required functionality to
 *  seemlessly integrate with the `TokenizedStrategy` implementation contract
 *  allowing anyone to easily build a fully permisionless ERC-4626 compliant
 *  Vault by inheriting this contract and overriding three simple functions.
 *  It utilizes an immutable proxy pattern that allows the BaseTokenizedStrategy
 *  to remain incredibly simple and small. All needed logic is held withen the
 *  `TokenizedStrategy` and is reused over any n strategies all using the
 *  `fallback` function to delegatecall the implementation so that strategists
 *  can only be concerned with writing their strategy specific code.
 *
 *  This contract should be inherited and the three main abstract methods
 *  `_invest`, `_freeFunds` and `_totalInvested` implemented to adapt the
 *  Strategy to the particular needs it has to create a return. There are
 *  other optional methods that can be implemented to further customize
 *  the strategy if desired.
 *
 *  All default storage for the strategy will controlled and updated by the
 *  `TokenizedStrategy`. The implementation holds a storage struct that
 *  contains all needed global variables in a manual storage slot at roughly
 *  1e77. This means strategists can feel free to implement their own storage
 *  variables as they need with no concern of collisions. All global variables
 *  can be viewed within the implementation by a simple call using the
 *  `TokenizedStrategy` variable. IE: TokenizedStrategy.globalVariable();.
